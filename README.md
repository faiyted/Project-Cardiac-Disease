# Project Overview

Heart disease seems to be a serious and life-threatening condition that significantly impacts a large portion of the global population. Our analysis seeks to shed light on heart disease by examining factors such as age, gender, and physical data. The goal is to develop a clearer understanding of which demographics are more susceptible to heart disease and to identify effective prevention strategies. 


# Dataset by Heart Disease:
  - Dataset from Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman: Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 20, 16 (2020)

# Dataset columns:
  - age: The age of the patient in years.
  - anaemia: Indicates whether the patient has anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells.
  - creatinine_phosphokinase: The level of the enzyme creatinine phosphokinase in the blood, an indicator of muscle damage.
  - diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has diabetes, a chronic condition that affects blood sugar regulation.
  - ejection_fraction: The percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart's left ventricle with each contraction, a measure of heart function.
  - high_blood_pressure: Indicates whether the patient has high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition that can lead to heart disease and other complications.
  - platelets: The count of platelets in the blood, which are essential for blood clotting.
  - serum_creatinine: The level of creatinine in the blood, an indicator of kidney function.
  - serum_sodium: The level of sodium in the blood, important for maintaining fluid balance and nerve function.
  - sex: The gender of the patient.
  - smoking: Indicates whether the patient is a smoker, a risk factor for many health conditions including heart disease.
  - time: The follow-up period in days for the patient, representing the time since the beginning of the study or treatment.
  - DEATH_EVENT: Indicates whether the patient has died during the follow-up period.

# Analysis will be on:

** How does age related to cardiac disease

** How does sex related to cardiac disease

** How the physical data to affect cardiac disease

** Develop models to predict the risk of death or other outcomes based on the health metrics provided

** Identify and quantify the impact of different risk factors (like smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure) on patient outcomes

** Summarize and visualize the distribution of health metrics and outcomes within the patient population
