# Project Overview

Heart disease seems to be a serious and life-threatening condition that significantly impacts a large portion of the global population. Our analysis seeks to shed light on heart disease by examining factors such as age, gender, and physical data. The goal is to develop a clearer understanding of which demographics are more susceptible to heart disease and to identify effective prevention strategies.
